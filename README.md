## About
Hi, I'm Kenny! I have a background in IT and a growing interest in working with data. I am on track to completing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.  I’ve developed a solid foundation in data analysis techniques and enjoy turning raw information into clear, meaningful insights that support smarter decision-making.

Through my experience, I’ve built up skills in working with structured and unstructured data, using tools to clean, organize, and extract key patterns and trends. I’m especially interested in how data can be used to drive impact in areas like sustainability, technology, and development. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tools and technologies in the data space, and I’m always eager to learn more. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world challenges and continuously improving along the way.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.

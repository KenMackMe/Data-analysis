## About
Hi, I'm Kenny! I have a background in IT and a growing interest in working with data. I am on track to completing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.  Iâ€™ve developed a solid foundation in data analysis techniques and enjoy turning raw information into clear, meaningful insights that support smarter decision-making.

# Portfolio projects
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
